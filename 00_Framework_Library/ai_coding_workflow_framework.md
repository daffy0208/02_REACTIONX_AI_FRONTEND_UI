# AI Coding Assistant Workflow Framework

## Core AI Coding Process

**An enterprise-grade, 8-phase workflow framework that transforms AI coding from "vibe coding" to systematic, validated software development through Context Engineering and Product Requirements Prompts (PRPs).**

### 1. Context Initialization Phase
- **Establish Project Constitution**: Define CLAUDE.md or equivalent project-wide rules
- **Configure AI Assistant Settings**: Set up slash commands, MCP servers, and integrations
- **Initialize Examples Repository**: Populate with code patterns, testing approaches, and architectural examples
- **Validate Tool Connectivity**: Ensure AI assistant can access codebase, documentation, and required tools

### 2. Requirements Engineering Phase  
- **Create Initial Requirements Document**: Draft INITIAL.md with specific, actionable feature descriptions
- **Gather Context Sources**: Identify relevant documentation, API references, and integration points
- **Define Success Criteria**: Establish measurable validation gates and acceptance criteria
- **Document Constraints and Considerations**: Include security requirements, performance needs, and architectural constraints

### 3. Context Engineering Phase
- **Apply Deterministic Context**: Leverage project rules, examples, and explicit documentation
- **Research Probabilistic Context**: Allow AI to search, analyze codebase patterns, and gather domain knowledge  
- **Generate Comprehensive PRP**: Create Product Requirements Prompt with complete implementation blueprint
- **Validate PRP Quality**: Score confidence level (1-10) and ensure all context is comprehensive

### 4. Implementation Planning Phase
- **Decompose PRP into Tasks**: Break down implementation into discrete, validatable components
- **Establish Validation Checkpoints**: Define tests, linting rules, and quality gates for each component
- **Create Implementation Sequence**: Order tasks to minimize dependencies and enable incremental validation
- **Prepare Error Handling Strategy**: Define recovery procedures and debugging approaches

### 5. Execution Phase
- **Execute PRP Implementation**: Follow systematic implementation plan with continuous validation
- **Apply Validation Gates**: Run tests, security scans, and quality checks at each checkpoint
- **Iterate on Failures**: Use error patterns from PRP to fix issues and retry validation
- **Maintain Context Integrity**: Prevent context rot through systematic information management

### 6. Quality Assurance Phase
- **Automated Code Review**: Apply AI-powered analysis for bugs, vulnerabilities, and standards compliance
- **Security Validation**: Scan for OWASP vulnerabilities, dependency issues, and security anti-patterns
- **Performance Testing**: Validate performance requirements and identify optimization opportunities
- **Integration Testing**: Ensure component interactions work correctly within larger system

### 7. Human Review Phase
- **Strategic Code Review**: Focus on architectural decisions, business logic, and integration patterns
- **Context Quality Assessment**: Validate that implementation matches requirements and maintains project consistency
- **Security Sign-off**: Human verification of security-critical components and access patterns
- **Documentation Review**: Ensure generated documentation is accurate and maintainable

### 8. Deployment & Learning Phase
- **Production Deployment**: Apply CI/CD pipelines with final quality gates and deployment automation
- **Performance Monitoring**: Track real-world performance and identify areas for optimization
- **Context Learning Update**: Capture successful patterns for future PRP generation
- **Workflow Optimization**: Refine process based on outcomes and team feedback

## Key AI Coding Principles

### Context Engineering Mastery
- **Systematic Context Management**: Treat context as code - version control, test, and refactor systematically
- **Deterministic Foundation**: Build on project rules, examples, and explicit documentation before leveraging AI discovery
- **Context Isolation**: Prevent context rot through intelligent partitioning and validation boundaries
- **Dynamic Adaptation**: Continuously update context based on project evolution and learning outcomes

### Quality-First Automation
- **Validation Gates**: Every implementation step must pass automated quality checkpoints before proceeding
- **Security by Design**: Embed security scanning and vulnerability detection throughout the workflow
- **Context-Aware Testing**: Generate tests that understand project architecture, patterns, and business logic
- **Continuous Integration**: Integrate AI workflow outputs with existing CI/CD pipelines and quality systems

### Human-AI Collaboration
- **Strategic Orchestration**: Humans design workflows, set standards, and make architectural decisions
- **AI Task Execution**: AI handles implementation, testing, and documentation generation within defined boundaries
- **Feedback Loops**: Continuous learning from human review to improve AI context and decision-making
- **Trust Building**: Build confidence through transparent validation and consistent quality outcomes

### Enterprise Scalability
- **Standardized Workflows**: Consistent processes across teams, projects, and technology stacks
- **Governance Integration**: Compliance with security policies, coding standards, and audit requirements
- **Team Knowledge Sharing**: Capture and distribute successful patterns and context engineering approaches
- **Toolchain Integration**: Seamless operation with existing development tools and enterprise systems

## Validation Strategy

### Before Implementation
- **Context Quality Gate**: PRP confidence score ≥ 8/10 with comprehensive coverage
- **Requirements Validation**: All success criteria clearly defined and measurable
- **Tool Integration Check**: AI assistant has access to all required systems and documentation
- **Security Policy Compliance**: Implementation plan adheres to enterprise security requirements

### During Implementation
- **Checkpoint Validation**: Each implementation component passes automated tests and quality scans
- **Context Integrity Check**: Monitor for context rot and maintain focus on current implementation goals
- **Incremental Quality Gates**: Code coverage, security scans, and performance benchmarks at each step
- **Human Oversight Triggers**: Escalate complex decisions and architectural changes for human review

### After Implementation
- **Full System Testing**: Integration tests, security validation, and performance verification
- **Production Readiness Gate**: Deployment pipeline validation and monitoring setup
- **Knowledge Capture**: Document successful patterns and update project context for future use
- **Stakeholder Acceptance**: Business validation of delivered functionality and quality standards

```bash
# Set up project structure
mkdir jwt_auth_system && cd jwt_auth_system

# Initialize AI coding context
echo "# Project Rules
- Use TypeScript with strict typing
- Follow security-first development practices
- Generate comprehensive tests for all authentication flows
- Use bcrypt for password hashing, never plain text
- Implement proper JWT token rotation and validation
