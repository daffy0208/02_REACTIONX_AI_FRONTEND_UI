## Critical Success Rules

### **NON-NEGOTIABLE REQUIREMENTS**

1. **ARCHITECTURE FIRST** - Never implement without proper system design and approval
2. **SECURITY BY DESIGN** - Security controls must be implemented from the beginning
3. **COMPREHENSIVE TESTING** - Minimum 90% test coverage with meaningful tests
4. **PROPER LAYERING** - Clear separation between presentation, business, and data layers
5. **ERROR HANDLING** - All error scenarios must be handled gracefully with proper responses
6. **INPUT VALIDATION** - All inputs must be validated and sanitized at entry points
7. **AUDIT LOGGING** - All data changes must be logged for compliance and debugging
8. **PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION** - Database queries optimized and caching implemented
9. **MONITORING REQUIRED** - Comprehensive observability and alerting implemented
10. **DOCUMENTATION COMPLETE** - All APIs documented with examples and schemas

### **VALIDATION CHECKPOINTS**

- **Pre-implementation**: Architecture review, technology approval, security planning
- **During development**: Code reviews, test coverage, security scans, performance testing
- **Pre-deployment**: Integration testing, security validation, performance benchmarking
- **Post-deployment**: Monitoring validation, incident response testing, documentation review

### **INTEGRATION REQUIREMENTS**

- **Context Engineering**: Integration with PRP methodology and validation gates
- **MCP Compatibility**: Support for MCP server integration and tool connectivity
- **AI Development Workflow**: Seamless integration with four-phase AI development process
- **Testing Framework**: Automated testing with comprehensive coverage and reporting
- **Deployment Pipeline**: CI/CD integration with automated quality gates and rollback procedures
