- **Dynamic Filtering**: Continuously remove outdated or low-quality content
- **Context Selectivity**: Prioritize most relevant information to prevent "lost in the middle" issues

### 2. Semantic Understanding
- **Beyond Keywords**: Use embedding-based similarity for true semantic matching
- **Query Intent Recognition**: Understand whether queries are factual, analytical, or creative
- **Contextual Adaptation**: Adjust retrieval strategy based on conversation context

### 3. Multi-Modal Intelligence
- **Content Type Diversity**: Handle text, images, code, tables, and structured data
- **Cross-Modal Retrieval**: Find relevant text for image queries and vice versa
- **Format-Aware Processing**: Preserve and utilize document structure and formatting

### 4. Temporal Awareness
- **Freshness Weighting**: Prioritize recent information for time-sensitive topics
- **Historical Context**: Maintain access to historical information when relevant
- **Real-Time Updates**: Integrate live data feeds for dynamic domains

### 5. Transparency & Trust
- **Source Attribution**: Always provide clear citations and source references
- **Confidence Scoring**: Indicate confidence levels in retrieved information
- **Explanation Generation**: Help users understand why specific information was selected
